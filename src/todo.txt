DONE - Create separate plotting file, with functions to isolate for certain alpha, beta values, to graph
    - Should be easy, just remove the columns that don't have the correct alpha beta values, then use the same config to graph. 

- Just do: close medium (we'll leave far for next experiment)
- Try one where, shifted a lot, so that the linear model may fail, but keep the variance low, so classical should still work well
    - For the above, we might need something like squared dist. 

- Might have too many configurations, decide which ones are important:
    - Size of gold
    - Size of unlabelled
    - Training size
    - Clippage
- The story we should be just trying to tell though is simply,
    - The X distribution is too far from training
    - Then adjust for when Naive good, PPI bad.
    - Might have to change the Y - transformation to not have infinite noise(?)
        - Can test that one in a notebook
    - To be fair, training size will also be a factor of how well perform

- Remember, we are testing performance as a functin of distance from training
Configurations:
    - Unlabelled here is irrelevant (it has not much to do with performance)
    - Gold also doesn't really matter
    - Training size does matter (do we see the unlablled or not) 3x
    - Clipping yes or noise 2x
    - Model performance (good or bad) 2x  
- 12x total configs
